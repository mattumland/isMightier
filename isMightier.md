## An Adventure for [Cairn](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn)
### Cartography by [Dyson Logos](https://dysonlogos.blog/) / Art by [Perplexing Ruins](https://www.perplexingruins.com/)

  *"I was a mapmaker and well-regarded, travelling distant lands recording the world for nobles, universities, warlords. My craft was my joy. Once I found [the Quill](#the-quill) everything changed. I craved power and sought strange magic to sate my hunger to create. Eventually I realized this need was not mine but the Quill's. It drove me like a beast of burden. When I could longer please it, it trapped me [here](#8-inner-sanctum)."*

  ### Adventure Hooks
  * A merchant has been waiting on the completion of an [atlas](#8-inner-sanctum) of trade routes for months. They will hire you to retrieve the atlas from the Cartographer's lair. 
  * The grand vizier of a local noble has heard rumors that the Cartographer employs a [magic quill](#8-inner-sanctum) to create such remarkable maps. They offer you a small fortune to steal it, by any means necessary. 
  * A glass maker is trying to mount an expedition to the fabled Forgotten Observatory. They will pay well for a [map](#8-inner-sanctum) to the mysterious location.
